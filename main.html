            A Little Background
        </h1>
            <p>
                I'm a current second year at UCLA pursuing a Mathematics of Computation (fancy Math/CS) bachelor's as well as a minor in Film and TV.
                Born and raised in Long Island, New York (about a 45 minute drive to Manhattan), I attended The Wheatley School. I took 13 AP classes and exams, 7 honors and enriched 
                courses, was President of Video Club, an officer of National Honor Society, an editor for the school newspaper, and participated in Varsity Track. At Long Island,
                I have a part time job as a lifeguard since the summer of junior year. For my higher education, I traveled westward to sunny California.

            <h2> What is your main goal?</h2>
            <p>
                Growing up, I had two formative interests: storytelling and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my life, I've explored ways stories are told. I'm particularly interested in the art of cinema, as film and television 
                have become my favorite sources of media. I also have an interest in storytelling in video games.
                <p>
                Parallel to my interest in media, I've also been lured to the potentials of technology and science. I taught myself how to code, hardware components of computers,
                and took multiple CS classes in high school. 
                </p>
                <p>
                My goal is to merge these two interests. I'm seeking a career that intersects the use of technology and media. I'm interested in developing tools, such as those
                that help people access media, software to help filmmakers perfect their visions, or even directly telling stories with coding through video games.
                </p>
            </p>
            <h2> You can code? What languages do you use and what experience have you had in them? What other skills in software construction do you have?</h2>
            <p> 
                Here's the list:
                <ul>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>HTML5 and CSS</li>
                    <li>R</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                </ul>
                At UCLA, the intro CS courses are instructed in C++. It's a great way to learn low level topics like memory management as well as object oriented programming.
                <br> 
                Some of my projects include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ghostracer</li> <!-- Make subparagraphs for each project-->
                    <li>Wurd</li>
                </ul>
                For class, I developed (with four other classmates) a website using HTML and JavaScript.  <!-- Insert SaveStates later-->
                <br>
                Other software skills I have used include shell scripting, Linux commands, and Git.
            </p>
            <h2> You like movies? What's your favorite film?</h2>
            <p>
                The film that got me into films is Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove (1964) <!-- Italize the movie-->. 
                I like Kubrick's audacity to boldly challenge global politics during the height of the Cold War, but I love how he approached it as a dark comedy. While most
                would approach nuclear devastation with fear, Kubrick used cinema to break conventions, and I believe the impact comes from the use of filmmaking as storytelling.
                Watching Seller's performance is much funnier than reading it, his ironic musical montage ending can only be done in movies, and the cinematography and production
                design immerse us in the political setting more than any nonvisual story could. 
                <br>
                Other favorites include (in no particular order):
                <ul>
                    <li>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</li>
                    <li>Fargo</li>
                    <li>Star Wars: A New Hope</li>
                    <li>Zodiac</li>
                    <li>Parasite</li>
                    <li>Spider-Man 2 (2004)</li>
                    <li>Network</li>
                    <li>Raiders of the Lost Ark</li>
                    <li>Akira</li>
                    <li>12 Angry Men</li>
                    <li>The 400 Blows</li>
                    <li>Lawrence of Arabia</li>
                    <li>There Will Be Blood</li>
                    <li>Citizen Kane</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2> So you like movies and coding, what else do you like?</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy listening to rock music. I particularly enjoy classic rock and alternative rock, though I've recently ventured in listening to indie and folk rock. 
                I'm also exporing other genres. The new genre I'm liking the most is electronic, and I particularly enjoyed M83's Hurry Up, We're Dreaming. Please send me more
                electronic recommendations!
                Some of my favorite artists are:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Beatles</li> <!-- Should I divide the list by decades?-->
                    <li>The Rolling Stones</li>
                    <li>Nirvana</li>
                    <li>Weezer</li>
                    <li>The Who</li>
                    <li>Radiohead</li>
                    <li>Pink Floyd</li>
                    <li>The Velvet Underground</li>
                </ul>
                I like rock so much that I wanted to imitate my favorite artists. I taught myself guitar in 8th grade using my dad's old acoustic. 
                <br>
                I'm also learning Mandarin. Growing up in a Chinese-American household, I always felt at least somewhat guilty about not learning Chinese (in my defense, it's so hard).
                I have a 240+ day streak on Duolingo, though I'm looking to be more intensive by learning from my numerous Chinese-American peers at college. 
                <br>
                I'm always down to learn more about history, particularly 20th century American history. I find it interesitng to see how rapidly my coutnry changed over past 
                century, as well as finding patterns repeating today (for better or worse). From the developing ubiquity of computers, to political protests, to maturity of art,
                I find the 20th century to be a wealth of historical events.
                <br>
                A hobby tied to cinema is photography. One year, during a family trip, my dad trusted me with his DSLR camera. I researched the settings and taught myself the
                elements to make a good picture. I read online articles about the significance of lens length, how to adjust exposure, and how to frame a picture to look good.

            <h2> Ok nerd.</h2>
            <p>
                Hey, I have other interests.
                <br>
                My favorite sport is easily football. It's exciting to see everyone's split second decisions and seeing how everyone reacts to them. Plus, there's tackling. 
                <br>
                My favorite NFL team is the New York Giants. The underdog story of the 2012 Super Bowl is what got me into the sport. Kind of a shame of where we are now. 
                However, collegiate football is an exciting story right now. Although UCLA is known more for their basketball program, we've been killing it in football recently.
                I've never felt more school pride when we beat the Trojans. Actually, we didn't just beat them, we pummeled them in their own stadium. It was great. 
                <br>
                I like basketball too, it's my second favorite sport. The Knicks used to be my favorite team, but the Nets have taken that place. It's not bandwagoning, I swear.
                The Nets just so happen to be the more interesting team, especially with its cultural ties to Brooklyn. And yes, I'm very excited for UCLA's basketball season.
                <br>
                Last year, I took a class on the effects of diet and exercise. Inspired by what I learned, I took up regular weight lifting again after 5 years of not training. 
                I've been counting my macros, calories, and been going to my school's gym five-six times a week. Since there's a free gym for students, I figure I should take 
                advantage of its convenience while I can. I'm also taking advantage of the food from dining halls, especially the buffet style ones. <!-- Plug a fitness blog?-->
                <br>
                In terms of cardio, I enjoy swimming and biking. I swam regularly during summer and was encouraged to be a lifeguard. I've worked every summer since 2019 as a 
                lifeguard, making a save during the last day of the 2021 season. Being a lifeguard also taught me how to enforce and communicate rules, be a responsible
                coworker, and patience when dealing with unruly patrons.

            <h2> What are you studying? What is "Mathematics of Computation"? </h2>
            <p>
                Mathematics of Computation (abbreviated as "Math of Comp") is a BS in the Letters and Science College under the math department. We study a lot of math, but we 
                also many CS courses. These CS courses include data structures, algorithms, introduction to computer organization, and software construction. We also have the 
                option to take many statistics courses, including probabilty and courses related to the software language R. Basically, it's the best of math, CS, and statistics.
                It's a great pathway to software engineering, data science, machine learning, and countless other fields!
